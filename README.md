## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand daily and weekly activity patterns  
- Analyze relationships between steps, calories, and active minutes  
- Identify user engagement trends  
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve fitness outcomes  


## 🗂 Dataset
**Source:** Fitbit Data (CSV files)  
**Key tables used:**
- Daily Activity  
- Calories  

**Key columns:**
- Id, Activity Date, Total Steps, Total Distance
